Social Media Application where you can POST pictures, LIKE your friends' pictures and DELETE your pictures if required.

Some of the features and technologies that I have used in this project are:

- Quick SQL: I used this tool to generate SQL scripts for creating tables, indexes, triggers, and constraints for my database. It saves a lot of time and effort in designing the data model.
- Form and Card region including dialogs: I used these components to create user-friendly and responsive interfaces for displaying and editing data. I also used dialogs to show modal windows for confirming actions or displaying messages.
- Dynamic actions and custom events: I used these features to add interactivity and functionality to my website. I used dynamic actions to perform client-side or server-side actions based on user input or page events. I also used custom events to communicate between different regions or components on the page. You can learn more about dynamic actions here and custom events here.
